# data-runner

This repo is for all the work I have done with my running activities. 

I wrangled some data to create multiple graphs for the web based application. 

To start of with the web based application I used this link[[1]](#1) to open my result in stremalit using Pycharm. 

To run in Pycharm which is my case you can do the following:
1. Open Terminal inside your repo

2. Run the following
    2.1 Create a virtual environment (line 1)
    2.2 Activate the environment
    2.3 install streamlit in the environment
```
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install streamlit
```

3. Inside the environment you hhave to run streamlit
example: ```streamlit run sl1.py```

To make the line chart you can see me code or look for the page of streamlit[[2]](#2) and this[[3]](#3). 

To make the scatter plot you can check my code or go into this website for some help[[4]](#4)
