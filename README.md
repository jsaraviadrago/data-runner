# data-runner

This repo is for all the work I have done with my running activities. 

I wrangled some data to create multiple graphs for the web based application. 

To start of with the web based application I used this link[[1]](#1) to open my result in stremalit using Pycharm. 

To make the line chart you can see me code or look for the page of streamlit[[2]](#2) and this[[3]](#3).
